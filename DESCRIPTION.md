# 1.Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Tower Defense Game using Pygame. The game will feature a strategic gameplay where players place defensive towers to stop waves of enemies from reaching their base. The core mechanics include placing towers, upgrading them, managing in-game currency, and balancing different enemy types to create a challenging experience.

# 2.Project Review
Existing tower defense games like Bloons TD, Plants vs Zombies serve as inspiration.
This project will introduce unique elements such as custom AI for enemies, upgradable towers with different abilities, and dynamic difficulty scaling.

# 3.Programming Development
## 3.1 Game Concept
Players will place towers along a predefined enemy path.
Enemies will move towards the base, and towers will automatically attack them.
Defeating enemies grants in-game currency to buy or upgrade towers.
If too many enemies reach the base, the player loses.

## 3.2  Object-Oriented Programming Implementation

### UML Diagram

3.3 Algorithms Involved
Waypoint Navigation: Enemies follow a predefined path.
Collision Detection: Towersâ€™ projectiles detect enemy hits.
Wave System: Dynamically increases difficulty over time.

Statistical Data (Prop Stats)
4.1 Data Features
1.Enemy Defeated
2.Money spent
3.Wave Reached
4.Tower Types Used
5.Enemies Reached the base
6.Time Per Wave

4.2 Data Recording Method

4.3 Data Analysis Report



Why is it good to have this data? What can it be used for?
How will you obtain this feature data?
Which variable (and which class will you collect this from?)
How will you display this feature data (via summarization statistics or via graph)?
Enemy Defeated
Tracks how many enemies are killed by the player and helps analyze game difficulty.
Record the number of enemies defeated in 50 waves.

Money Spent
Measures player resource usage and economic behavior.
Track how much money is spent in each wave in 50 waves.

Box plot
Wave Reached
Shows how far the player can progress; useful to measure difficulty and progression.
Record the maximum wave reached per game
